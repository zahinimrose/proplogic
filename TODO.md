Project Idea: Propositional Logic Solver

Propositional logic, also known as sentential logic, deals with propositions and their logical relationships. In this project, you can create a program that acts as a propositional logic solver. It should be able to evaluate the truth value of complex propositions, simplify logical expressions, and perform basic operations on propositions.

Here are some features you can consider implementing:

Proposition evaluation: Create a function that evaluates the truth value of a given proposition. This function should handle basic logical operators like negation (~), conjunction (^), disjunction (v), implication (->), and bi-implication (<->). You can implement this using truth tables or by building an expression parser.

Proposition simplification: Develop a function that simplifies logical expressions by applying logical equivalences and simplification rules. For example, the expression "p ^ (q v p)" can be simplified to "p" using the idempotent law. Implement as many simplification rules as you can.

Truth table generator: Create a feature that generates the truth table for a given logical expression. The truth table should display all possible combinations of truth values for the proposition's variables and the resulting truth value for the expression.

Proposition equivalences: Implement functions to check the equivalence between two logical expressions. You can compare expressions using truth tables or by applying logical equivalences to simplify both expressions and compare the results.

Proposition validation: Create a validation function that checks if a given logical expression is syntactically correct. It should identify errors like mismatched parentheses or invalid characters.

Interactive interface: Develop an interactive interface that allows users to input logical expressions and perform various operations, such as evaluation, simplification, and equivalence checking. The program should provide clear output to the user.

Advanced features: If you want to challenge yourself further, you can implement additional features like parsing natural language statements into logical expressions or converting logical expressions into different normal forms (e.g., conjunctive normal form or disjunctive normal form).

As you work on this project, you'll gain a deeper understanding of propositional logic and logical operations. It will also enhance your programming skills, particularly in parsing and manipulating strings.

Remember to break down the project into smaller tasks and plan your implementation accordingly. You can start with the basic functionality and gradually add more advanced features.
